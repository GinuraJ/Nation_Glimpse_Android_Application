This Android application, built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, offers an engaging guessing game centered around country flags. Users can test their knowledge by identifying flags, guessing country names, and advancing through various difficulty levels. The application utilizes the standard Android API libraries and incorporates features such as random flag selection, character guessing, multiple-choice options, and a scoring system.

Features:

1) Guess the Country: Users are presented with a random flag image and a list of country names. They select the corresponding country and submit their guess. Immediate feedback is provided, indicating whether the answer is correct or incorrect.

2) Guess-Hints: Users guess the country name character by character, with hints provided for correct guesses. Incorrect attempts are limited, and users must submit their answers within a specified number of tries.

3) Guess the Flag: Users select the correct flag image out of three displayed options. Immediate feedback is given, and users can proceed to the next set of flags.

4) Advanced Level: Users must guess the names of three displayed flags by typing the country names into corresponding text boxes. Feedback is provided for correct and incorrect answers, with limited attempts allowed.

5) User-Friendly Interface: The application seamlessly adjusts to screen orientation changes, ensuring a consistent user experience across portrait and landscape modes.

6) Countdown Timer: An optional feature allows users to enable a countdown timer for each game level. Once activated, the timer counts down from 10 to 1, simulating user actions of submitting answers or advancing to the next screen.
